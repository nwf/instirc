This depends on Math::BaseCalc from CPAN.  This is conveniently packaged in
Debian as libmath-basecalc-perl.  To fetch from CPAN if your OS doesn't
provide CPAN packages, do
  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Math::BaseCalc'

These perl modules assume they exist in a directory called Instance.  The
easiest way to make this fly, by far, is to symlink the place you got these
sources as ~/.irssi/scripts/Instance.  Then you can tell irssi to
"/script load Instance/IrssiInterface.pl" and everything should be fine.

To run tests in the current directory, you should "ln -s . Instance" too.

The UI is currently rather spartan, defining the following commands:
    /instance [label]      sets the default instance for the current window
                           to label, or stops sending default tags if label
                           is omitted.

    /instsay label message sends the message with the given instance label
                           but does not set or alter the default.

    /punt   label     Causes the current window to not display messages
                      tagged with instance "label".

    /unpunt label     Undoes the action of the punt command.
