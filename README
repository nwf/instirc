This depends on Math::BaseCalc from CPAN.  This is conveniently packaged in
Debian as libmath-basecalc-perl.  To fetch from CPAN if your OS doesn't
provide CPAN packages, do
  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Math::BaseCalc'

These perl modules assume they exist in a directory called Instance.  The
easiest way to make this fly, by far, is to symlink the place you got these
sources as ~/.irssi/scripts/Instance.  Then you can tell irssi to
"/script load Instance/IrssiInstancer.pl" and everything should be fine.

To run tests in the current directory, you should "ln -s . Instance" too.

The UI is currently rather spartan, defining the following commands:
    /instance [label]      sets the default instance for the current window
                           to label, or stops sending default tags if label
                           is omitted.

    /instsay label message sends the message with the given instance label
                           but does not set or alter the default.

    /instpunt    label     Causes the current window to not display messages
                           tagged with instance "label".

    /instunpunt label      Undoes the action of the punt command.

    /instlist              Lists punted (and routed) instances in the current
                           window.

    /say    message   [Not defined by this script]
                      will send the message to the current window without
                      an instance label, even if a default is set.

We suggest that you alias commands to more convenient forms:

/alias i instance
/alias il instlist
/alias ip instpunt
/alias is instsay
/alias iu instunpunt

See TODO for things if you want to help out.
