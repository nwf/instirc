Protocol Implementation Core
    Doesn't buy into instance continuation messages, since we have
    yet to observe a need.

Irssi Module Core
    Remove code duplication between inst_filter_*?
    Factor out punt list management to its own frontend-agnostic module?
    Factor out instance label ^     ^   ^   ^      ^       ^       ^

Missing UI Features
    Options to persist the punts list and or instance defaults?
    Punts listing command (per channel, global)
    Ability to /msg or /query with instance label.
    Ability to /me with an instance label.
    The ability to filter instances out of the channel windows to their
        own windows.

Perl Questions
    Can we do better with the Perl @INC thing?
        ("How did I get here?  I am not good with computer!")

Known Bugs

  We don't yet support routing, just punting, for private messages.  However,
  the frontend currently doesn't distinguish these, leading to the potential
  for confusion.
